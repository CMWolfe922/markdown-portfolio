Since this tutorial is __making me__ write out _"awesome"_ stuff about myself and ___emphasize it___, I'll just make __another__ list about what I like ❤️ about myself.
* I like that I am ___very___ curious when it comes to learning _anything_ new.
* I like how outgoing I am ___(usually)___ 🙂
  * On that note, I like how comfortable I am speaking to random people.
* I __love__ my work ethic, ___especially___ when I am working towards something I am interested in! 🏢 ⏰ 🏃‍♂️
